# webserver
Simple Java web server

-- Built this web server as a project for my computer networking class. 

Instructions:

1. Compile the WebServer.java file from cmd
2. Run WebServer
3. From a browser visit your-ip-address:8000/TestFile.html
4. Control C in cmd to kill the server

TestFile.html located in the src folder is the current file that the server can fetch. This can be updated to a different file.
